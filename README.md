# FSharpRemarks

A humble attempt at recreating the Remarks application:
[https://github.com/DIKU-EDU/remarks](DIKU-EDU/remarks)

This project aims to ease the parsing of strings by utilizing the built-in
string functionalities provided by F# and the .NET platform.


_This project is by no account officially related to Remarks_.
